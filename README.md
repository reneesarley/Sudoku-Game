# _Sudoku Game_

#### _A Sudoku Game, 11/14/18_

#### _**Renee Sarley**_

## Description

_This application will function like a traditional Sudoku game. Each 3x3 square, each row and each column will have each digit from 1-9, digits cannot be duplicated within a 3x3 square, row or column. Users can toggle between typing notes or actual guesses within each square. Guesses will be checked once typed. Notes will be ignored until converted to guesses. If a guess is incorrect it will be colored red, if it is correct it will be colored green. Once the board is filled in with all the correct guesses the player wins._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Download the github repo_
* _Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`._

## User Stories - MVP

* _A user should be able to type a 'guess' digit into the square and have the digit be checked for accuracy_
* _A user should be able to toggle between making notes and making guesses_
* _A user should be able to type a 'note' digit into the square and not have the digit be checked for accuracy_
* _A user should be able to enter up to 9 different 'note' digits into a box_
* _A user should be able to generate a new game_
* _A user should see some digits filled in when the game starts_

## User Stories - Additional features for future implementation

* _A user should see a timer for the game_
* _A user should be able to change the difficulty of the game_
* _A user should be able to see which digits are still left to be used_
* _A user should be able to see which digits have been completely used (already on the board 9 times)_
* _A user should see like digits highlighted when they click on a certain digit. I.e. click on a two, the other twos on the board will be highlighted._
